# AXPLOR - REACHING FOR THE STARS

## Our Vision

Growing up, we saw how governments around the world raced to explore space. Man had already put his foot on the moon long before we were born, but it didn't make space any less wondrous. So many probes had been sent into space, solely so we could learn what was out there. It was every child's drean to be an astronaut.

But the opportunity of becoming an astronaut was solely confined to the halls of the government. Although the governmental space agencies greatly boosted our knowledge and fascination with space, they made it so hard to get there. Only a select few were given the opportunity to become astronauts. And, just as importantly, they didn't provide civilian space tourism programs \- opportunities for normal people to go out and see the vast expanse of space.

That's what we set out to do. In the year 2051, we established AXPLOR, the first corporation fully dedicated to giving civlians a chance to see space for themselves, up close. We pledged to keep the barriers and costs of entry as low as possible, so that everyone can have a chance to become an astronaut. And we've stuck to that pledge.

Of all the space tourism companies out there, you won't find a better, more dedicated one than AXPLOR. [Join us today](Schedule-a-Trip/Tickets.md)
