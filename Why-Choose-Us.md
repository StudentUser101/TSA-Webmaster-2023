# AXPLOR - REACHING FOR THE STARS

## Why Choose Us?

AXPLOR is dedicated to giving you the best space tourism opportunity possible. After all, that's what we do \- we're a space tourism company, so we put our entire effort into making sure we do our job well. That's unlike many other megacorporations, who choose to pursue civilian space tourism programs as a side hustle instead of giving it their full attention. With our team of professionals fully focused on giving you the best experience, you can be confident you'll enjoy your ride with us.

And we have the experience to back it up. Over the course of the past 30 years, we've provided thousands of space tours to many individuals, crafting multiple different experiences that tailor to each of our customers. Prominent magazines have featured us on their front pages. Celebrities have glowingly complimented us. And all that time, we've never stopped improving, striving to give the people an even better experience than they had last time.

As a result, with some of the most dedicated and experienced people working at AXPLOR, we've managed to work tirelessly to provide space tourism at an affordable cost. Not so long ago, it was considered far-fetched that the average family might one day afford a space tour. But that didn't stop us, and 30 years later, we've achieved that goal.

You don't have to take our word for our affordability \- you can see it for yourself right on the next page.
