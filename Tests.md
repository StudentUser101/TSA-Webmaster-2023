# AXPLOR - REACHING FOR THE STARS

## Costs - Testing

Once we make our rockets, we test them rigorously to ensure that they meet the high safety and quality standards we hold here at AXPLOR. We never release a rocket that fails to pass all our tests \- the lives of our passengers are far more important to us than our profits.

At the same time, as the first space tourism company, we couldn't chance being too financially risky of a company. So, we came up with a tried-and-true 5-test approach that will allow only the best and safest rockets to come out onto the market.

1) Engine Tests \- Do the engines work? Can they lift the rocket? Are they fuel-efficient enough? All these things matter if we want to make sure our passengers don't get stranded in space.

2) Testing the Life Support Systems \-How is the air supply in our rockets? How is the water supply? Can food be safely stored for the duration of the trip? These are the minimum essentials. A rocket that can't pass these tests is in no way suitable for space tourism.

3) Comfort Tests \- Is the rocket's ascent likely to cause the passengers pain? Is there enough space in the rocket for the passengers to enjoy their trip? Are amenities provided, and do they work?

4) Quality Tests \- Is everything of high quality? Are we absolutely sure that nothing onboard will be damaged on the trip? Are we absolutely sure that the rocket itself won't be damaged on the trip?

5) Putting it all together \- With all the changes we've made, does the rocket still pass all of these tests?

If a rocket fails to pass any one of these tests, we continue working on it, and don't let it move forward onto the next test, until it passes the current one. This way, we can ensure that the rocket is of high quality, while also ensuring that testing costs don't push it over-budget.

And it works \- none of our rockets have ever exceeded a budget of $10 billion.
