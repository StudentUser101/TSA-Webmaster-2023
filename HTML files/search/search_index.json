Man had already put his foot on the moon long before we were born, but it didn't make space any less wondrous. So many probes had been sent into space, solely so we could learn what was out there. It was every child's drean to be an astronaut. But the opportunity of becoming an astronaut was solely confined to the halls of the government. Although the governmental space agencies greatly boosted our knowledge and fascination with space, they made it so hard to get there. Only a select few were given the opportunity to become astronauts. And, just as importantly, they didn't provide civilian space tourism programs - opportunities for normal people to go out and see the vast expanse of space. That's what we set out to do. In the year 2051, we established AXPLOR, the first corporation fully dedicated to giving civlians a chance to see space for themselves, up close. We pledged to keep the barriers and costs of entry as low as possible, so that everyone can have a chance to become an astronaut. And we've stuck to that pledge.

After all, that's what we do - we're a space tourism company, so we put our entire effort into making sure we do our job well.

With our team of professionals fully focused on giving you the best experience, you can be confident you'll enjoy your ride with us. And we have the experience to back it up. Over the course of the past 30 years, we've provided thousands of space tours to many individuals, crafting multiple different experiences that tailor to each of our customers.

As a result, with some of the most dedicated and experienced people working at AXPLOR, we've managed to work tirelessly to provide space tourism at an affordable cost.

If those are in order, other things can be taken care of. If they're not, then there's not much the company can do. When we started out at AXPLOR, we knew that as the first space tourism company on the market, we had to make sure we had these in order. Our first tourism rocket may not have been much, but it served two important purposes: It could fly and complete a basic trip. It was completed under a sound budget. And with those two requirements satisfied, that rocket, Rocket 56, took off in 2056. Within 5 years, we'd sold 30,000 tickets, with the rate of sales coninuing to increase. So successful was Rocket 56, it's still offering tours today We took the same principles we used to create Rocket 56, and have applied them to every rocket we've made ever since. That commitment can be seen in our finances - none of our rocket's R&D costs have ever exceeded $10 billion. And that figure includes the tests we've run on our rockets, which you can see for yourself on the next page.","title":"Cost of R&D"},{"location":"Costs/Research-and-Development/#axplor-reaching-for-the-stars","text":"","title":"AXPLOR - REACHING FOR THE STARS"},{"location":"Costs/Research-and-Development/#costs-research-development","text":"The two most important things that can make or break a company are their product and their finances.

We never release a rocket that fails to pass all our tests - the lives of our passengers are far more important to us than our profits. At the same time, as the first space tourism company, we couldn't chance being too financially risky of a company. So, we came up with a tried-and-true 5-test approach that will allow only the best and safest rockets to come out onto the market. 1) Engine Tests - Do the engines work? Can they lift the rocket? Are they fuel-efficient enough? All these things matter if we want to make sure our passengers don't get stranded in space. 2) Testing the Life Support Systems -How is the air supply in our rockets? How is the water supply? Can food be safely stored for the duration of the trip? These are the minimum essentials. A rocket that can't pass these tests is in no way suitable for space tourism. 3) Comfort Tests - Is the rocket's ascent likely to cause the passengers pain? Is there enough space in the rocket for the passengers to enjoy their trip? Are amenities provided, and do they work? 4) Quality Tests - Is everything of high quality? Are we absolutely sure that nothing onboard will be damaged on the trip? Are we absolutely sure that the rocket itself won't be damaged on the trip? 5) Putting it all together - With all the changes we've made, does the rocket still pass all of these tests? If a rocket fails to pass any one of these tests, we continue working on it, and don't let it move forward onto the next test, until it passes the current one. This way, we can ensure that the rocket is of high quality, while also ensuring that testing costs don't push it over-budget. And it works - none of our rockets have ever exceeded a budget of $10 billion.","title":"Cost of Tests"},{"location":"Costs/Tests/#axplor-reaching-for-the-stars","text":"","title":"AXPLOR - REACHING FOR THE STARS"},{"location":"Costs/Tests/#costs-testing","text":"Once we make our rockets, we test them rigorously to ensure that they meet the high safety and quality standards we hold here at AXPLOR.
