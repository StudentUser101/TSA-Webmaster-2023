# AXPLOR - REACHING FOR THE STARS

## Scheduling - Tickets

So you want to schedule a trip. But which one do you want? It'd be very tiresome to search that up for yourself.

But we're a space tourism company. It's our job to help you make a tour, and so we've provided that information below for you.

* **ROCKET 56:**
    * The original, the one that started it all. It's been here for a quarter of a century, and it's still going strong. If you're on a tight budget, but still want a decent trip with your family, this is the rocket for you.

* **ROCKET 61:**
    * Our smallest and cheapest model. This rocket was made specifically for the fresh, out-of-college students who want to celebrate their graduation with a vacation, but don't have much money to do so. Perfect for solo travelers or couples, but ticket sizes don't allow for more than 2.

* **ROCKET 66:**
    * The family-sized rocket. While we'd served youngsters with Rocket 61, families were growing tired of what was now our 10-year-old original Rocket 56. This rocket has specifically been designed to cater to them. It comes with all sorts of amenities and toys for children, and allows for ticket sizes of up to 7 people. However, the ticket cost is also quite large.

* **ROCKET 75:**
    * For those of you seeking the premium experience, Rocket 75 is your best choice. With loads of amenities exclusive to just this rocket, it provides the perfect space tourism experience ... if you have the money. This option is best served with our [VIP Experience](Go-VIP.md)
