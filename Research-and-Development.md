# AXPLOR - REACHING FOR THE STARS

## Costs - Research & Development

The two most important things that can make or break a company are their product and their finances. If those are in order, other things can be taken care of. If they're not, then there's not much the company can do.

When we started out at AXPLOR, we knew that as the first space tourism company on the market, we had to make sure we had these in order.

Our first tourism rocket may not have been much, but it served two important purposes:

1. It could fly and complete a basic trip.
2. It was completed under a sound budget.

And with those two requirements satisfied, that rocket, Rocket 56, took off in 2056. Within 5 years, we'd sold 30,000 tickets, with the rate of sales coninuing to increase. So successful was Rocket 56, [it's still offering tours today](../Schedule-a-Trip/Tickets.md)

We took the same principles we used to create Rocket 56, and have applied them to every rocket we've made ever since. That commitment can be seen in our finances \- none of our rocket's R&D costs have ever exceeded $10 billion. And that figure includes the tests we've run on our rockets, which you can see for yourself on the next page.
